## Getting Started

This guide includes everything you need to know to get started with trade bots.

### Creation

:button-link[Create trade bots]{href="https://www.statsanytime.com/trade-bots"}

Trade bots can be created with the link above if you're signed in. You can either create it from scratch or use one of the pre-defined templates we've got. Just click `Get Started` and follow the instructions from there. If you use a template you might have to connect an integration to ensure the pipeline can work.

### Configuration

After having created your trade bot, it's time to configure it. This can be done in what we call the `pipeline`.

1. A pipeline always starts with a listener. Click on `Create Listener` -> `Item Listed` to get started. This listener will fire whenever an item is listed on the market you've chosen. At this point your pipeline works, but it doesn't do anything yet. Don't worry, we'll get there.
2. Click on the `+` next to the listener in the pipeline. From there, click on `Create Condition`. You'll then be able to set up a condition for when the pipeline should continue. If the condition passes, the pipeline will continue. If not, it'll stop. Here's an example of a condition that passes if the item's price is below 100 coins.

3. After having created this one, it's time to make a withdrawal! Click on the `+` once again, except click on `Create Action` this time. In the following modal you want to click `Withdraw ItemÂ´, then submit it.

Your pipeline should now look like this. If so, congratulations! You've just written your first pipeline.

### Usage

With the trade bot configured, you can now use it if you'd like. This would simply be a matter of clicking on `Overview` on the right followed by `Enable` which will start to process items. However, this is also when billing & costs would start to kick in.

You can track any withdrawals it's made from the trades view on the left. Any errors/issues is displayed under logs.
