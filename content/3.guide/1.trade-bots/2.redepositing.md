# Redepositing

This guide includes details on how to enable redepositing for your bot.

## Enable redeposits

Doing so is rather simple, and only requires you to add a single pipe to your pre-existing pipeline. Using the example that you created as part of the `Getting Started` guide, this is what you would have to do.

1. Click on the `+` next to the last pipe (`Withdraw Item Action`).
2. Select `Create Action`.
3. Choose `Redeposit item` in the following modal. From there, define a dynamic price at which items should be deposited for. Here's an example which will redeposit an item for 5% more than it was purchased for.

4. Create the action.

Your pipeline should now look like this. Assuming it does, congratulations! You've just enabled redepositing for your bot. It will automatically redeposit items whenever their tradelocks expire **if your bot is enabled**.

## How the system works in detail

The system works on a per-trade logic, meaning some items can be redeposited while others can be ignored, depending on the path they took in the pipeline. If an item reached the redeposit action, it'll have the following flag on it:

This indicates that the item will be redeposited when posssible.

## Redeposit items when trade bot is disabled

This can be enabled in your trade bot settings. Simply toggle the following setting:
