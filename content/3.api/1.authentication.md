### Aquire Access Token

A token can be aquired from your profile page under `Developer Settings`. From there, simply:

1. Click `Create API Key`
2. Enter a name for your access token
3. Copy the token you're given. Please note that it will only be shown once.

### Use token

Now, simply find an endpoint you'd like to use and pass the token along in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. Here's an example on how you could use it in JavaScript:

```js
fetch('https://www.statsanytime.com/api/user', {
    headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    },
});
```
